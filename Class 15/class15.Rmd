## Load the contData and colData

We need 2 things
- 1: count data
- 2: colData (the metadata that tells us about the deisgn of the experiment)

```{r}
counts <- read.csv("airway_scaledcounts.csv", row.names=1)
metadata <-  read.csv("airway_metadata.csv")
```

```{r}
head(counts)
```

```{r}
head(metadata)
```

> Q1. How many genes are in this dataset?
> 38694

```{r}
nrow(counts)
```

> Q2. How many ‘control’ cell lines do we have
>4

```{r}
View(metadata)
```

## Check the correspondance of the metadata with the counts data

```{r}
all(metadata$id == colnames(counts))
```
## Compare control to treated

> Q3. How would you make the above code in either approach more robust?

First we need to access all the control columns in our counts data

```{r}
control.inds <- metadata$dex == "control"
metadata[control.inds, ]$id
```

Use these ids to access just the control columns of our 'counts' data

```{r}
control.mean <- rowMeans(counts[ , control.inds])
head(control.mean)
```

Do the same for the drug treated...

> Q4. Follow the same procedure for the treated samples (i.e. calculate the mean per gene across drug treated samples and assign to a labeled vector called treated.mean)

```{r}
treated.inds <- metadata$dex == "treated"
treated.mean <- rowMeans(counts[ , treated.inds])
head(treated.mean)
```

We will combine our meancount data for bookkeeping purposes.

```{r}
meancounts <- data.frame(control.mean, treated.mean)
```

Compare the control and treated

> Q5 (a). Create a scatter plot showing the mean of the treated samples against the mean of the control samples. Your plot should look something like the following.

```{r}
plot(meancounts)
```

> Q5 (b).You could also use the ggplot2 package to make this figure producing the plot below. What geom_?() function would you use for this plot?

```{r}
# ggplot(meancounts, aes(control.mean, treated.mean)) + geom_point()
```

> Q6. Try plotting both axes on a log scale. What is the argument to plot() that allows you to do this? 

Try plotting both axes on a log scale

```{r}
plot(meancounts, log="xy")
```

Let's calculate the log2 fold change between control and dex-treated samples. 

```{r}
meancounts$log2fc <- log2(meancounts[,"treated.mean"]/meancounts[,"control.mean"])
head(meancounts)
```

We need to drop the zero count genes/rows!

```{r}
head(meancounts[,1:2] == 0)
```
> Q7. What is the purpose of the arr.ind argument in the which() function call above? Why would we then take the first column of the output and need to call the unique() function?
> arr.ind=TRUE returns the positions in a matrix that are "TRUE" as integers. The unique() function will delete duplicate rows (e.g. genes with zero counts in both control and treated samples). 

The 'which()' functions tell us the indices of TRUE entries in a logical vector

```{r}
inds <- which(meancounts[,1:2] == 0, arr.ind=TRUE)
head(inds)
```

I only care about the rows here (if there is a zero in any column I will exclude this row eventually)

```{r}
to.rm <- unique(sort(inds[,"row"]))
```

Remove the genes with zero expression from our meancounts data 

```{r}
mycounts <- meancounts[-to.rm,]
head(mycounts)
```

We now have "r nrow(mycounts)' genes remaining

```{r}
nrow(mycounts)
```

> Q8. Using the up.ind vector above can you determine how many up regulated genes we have at the greater than 2 fc level?

```{r}
up.ind <- mycounts$log2fc > 2
sum(up.ind)
```

What percentage is this?

```{r}
round((sum(up.ind) / nrow(mycounts))*100, 2)
```

> Q9. Using the down.ind vector above can you determine how many down regulated genes we have at the greater than 2 fc level?

```{r}
down.ind <- mycounts$log2fc < (-2)
sum(down.ind)
round((sum(down.ind) / nrow(mycounts))*100, 2)
```

> Q10. Do you trust these results? Why or why not?
> I don't trust that these results are significant as they they only take into account fold change and not p-values (i.e. significance). Genes exhibiting a 2-fold change may not be significant. 

# DESeq2 analysis

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
```

We first need to setup the DESeq input object

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData=counts, 
                              colData=metadata, 
                              design=~dex)
dds
```

Run the DESeq analysis pipeline

```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

```{r}
res <- results(dds)
head(res)
```

# A Volcano plot

Volcano plots highlight the proportion of genes that are both significantly regulated and display a high fold change

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange,  -log(res$padj))
abline(v=c(-2,2), col = "gray")
abline(h=-log(0.05), col="gray")
```

# Adding annotation data

```{r}
library("AnnotationDbi")
library("org.Hs.eg.db")
```

```{r}
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

Here, we map to "SYMBOL", the common gene names

```{r}
res$symbol <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=row.names(res), 
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        
                     column="SYMBOL",         
                     multiVals="first")

head(res$symbol)
```

# Let's save our results to date

```{r}
write.csv(res, file="allmyresults.csv")
```

# Pathway Analysis

Let's try to bring some biology insight back into this work. For this we will start with KEGG. 

```{r}
library(pathview)
library(gage)
library(gageData)
```

```{r}
data(kegg.sets.hs)

# Examine the first 2 pathways in this kegg set for humans
head(kegg.sets.hs, 2)
```

Before we can use KEGG we need to get our gene identifiers in the correct format for KEGG, which is ENTREZ format in this case. 

```{r}
res$entrez <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=row.names(res), 
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        
                     column="ENTREZID",         
                     multiVals="first")

res$genename <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db,
                     keys=row.names(res), 
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",        
                     column="GENENAME",         
                     multiVals="first")
```

The main gage() function requires a named vector of fold changes, where the names of the values are the Entrez gene IDs.

Note that we used the mapIDs() function above to obtain Entrez gene IDs (stored in res$entrez) and we have the fold change results from DESeq2 analysis (stored in res$log2FoldChange).

```{r}
foldchanges = res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

Now, let’s run the gage pathway analysis.

```{r}
# Get the results
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

We can look at the attributes() of this

```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```

```{r}
# Look at the first three down (less) pathways
head(keggres$less, 3)
```

Let's try out the pathview() function from the pathview package to make a pathway plot with our RNA-Seq expression results shown in color.

To begin with lets manually supply a pathway.id (namely the first part of the "hsa05310 Asthma") that we could see from the print out above.

```{r}
pathview(gene.data=foldchanges, pathway.id="hsa05310")
```
