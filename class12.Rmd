# Working with bio3d

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hel")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's do a quick bioinformatics prediction of protein dynamics (flexibility). We use the 'nma()' function, which does Normal Mode Analysis.

```{r}
modes <- nma(pdb)
plot(modes)
```

Make a trajectory of this prediction with the 'mktrj()'.

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="nma.pdb")
```

## Comparative Structure Analysis

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1AKE_A")
aa
```

I want to search the PDB database (the main db for exp structures) for sequences like my aa sequence.

```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

Now I have my top hits from the search of the PDB

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

Here we download all these similar structures in the PDB and store them on our computer

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

We will use the pdbaln() function to align and also optionally fit (i.e. superpose) the identified PDB structures

```{r}
# Align related PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE)
```

Let's look at our alignment

```{r}
pdbs
```

```{r}
# Vector containing PDB codes for figure axis
ids <- basename.pdb(pdbs$id)

# Draw schematic alignment
plot(pdbs, labels=ids)
```

```{r}
pdbs$xyz
```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Here we will do PCA on the xyz coordinate data of all these structures with the 'pca()' function in bio3d

```{r}
pc <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)
```

Let's visualize the displacements (i.e. movements of the structure) that are captured by PC1

```{r}
mktrj(pc, pc=1, file="pca.pdb")
```

![](pca.png)

Let's save our important results

```{r}
# save(blast, hits, pca, file="myresults.RData")
load("myresults.RData")
```
